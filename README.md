# Ontario Kids Discovery 🇨🇦

A data-driven, AI-powered mobile application designed to help parents in Ontario discover activities, safe daycares, and kid-friendly dining.

## 🌟 Core Vision

## 🚀 Key Features
1.  **Smart Feed**: "Gravity Algorithm" recommendations that balance distance, popularity, and seasonality.
2.  **Daycare Safety Lens**: Direct integration of Ontario government inspection data and AI-summarized reviews.
3.  **Family Sync**: Shared profiles, schedules, and favorites between parents.
4.  **AI Agents**: Automated weekly fetching of special events (festivals, pop-ups) using Gemini 3.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Supabase (PostgreSQL + PostGIS)
